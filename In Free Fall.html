                <p>
                    Imagine you are falling. But there is no ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many contemporary philosophers have pointed out that the present moment is distinguished by a
                    prevailing condition of groundlessness.<a href="#footnotes"><sup>1</sup></a>
                    We cannot assume any stable ground on which to base metaphysical claims or foundational political
                    myths. At best, we are faced with temporary, contingent,
                    and partial attempts at grounding. But if there is no stable ground available for our social lives
                    and philosophical aspirations, the consequence must be a permanent,
                    or at least intermittent state of free fall for subjects and objects alike. But why don’t we notice?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paradoxically, while you are falling, you will probably feel as if you are floating—or not even
                    moving at all. Falling is relational—if there is nothing to fall toward,
                    you may not even be aware that you’re falling. If there is no ground, gravity might be low and
                    you’ll feel weightless. Objects will stay suspended if you let go of them.
                    Whole societies around you may be falling just as you are. And it may actually feel like perfect
                    stasis—as if history and time have ended and you can’t even remember that
                    time ever moved forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you are falling, your sense of orientation may start to play additional tricks on you. The
                    horizon quivers in a maze of collapsing lines and you may lose any sense of
                    above and below, of before and after, of yourself and your boundaries. Pilots have even reported
                    that free fall can trigger a feeling of confusion between the self and the
                    aircraft. While falling, people may sense themselves as being things, while things may sense that
                    they are people. Traditional modes of seeing and feeling are shattered.
                    Any sense of balance is disrupted. Perspectives are twisted and multiplied. New types of visuality
                    arise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This disorientation is partly due to the loss of a stable horizon. And with the loss of horizon also
                    comes the departure of a stable paradigm of orientation, which has situated
                    concepts of subject and object, of time and space, throughout modernity. In falling, the lines of
                    the horizon shatter, twirl around, and superimpose.

                <p>
                    Our sense of spatial and temporal orientation has changed dramatically in recent years, prompted by
                    new technologies of surveillance, tracking, and targeting. One of the symptoms
                    of this transformation is the growing importance of aerial views: overviews, Google Map views,
                    satellite views. We are growing increasingly accustomed to what used to be called a
                    God’s-eye view. On the other hand, we also notice the decreasing importance of a paradigm of
                    visuality that long dominated our vision: linear perspective. Its stable and single
                    point of view is being supplemented (and often replaced) by multiple perspectives, overlapping
                    windows, distorted flight lines, and divergent vanishing points. How could these
                    changes be related to the phenomena of groundlessness and permanent fall?
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, let’s take a step back and consider the crucial role of the horizon in all of this. Our
                    traditional sense of orientation—and, with it, modern concepts of time and space—are
                    based on a stable line: the horizon line. Its stability hinges on the stability of an observer, who
                    is thought to be located on a ground of sorts, a shoreline, a boat—a ground that
                    can be imagined as stable, even if in fact it is not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The horizon line was an extremely important element in navigation. It defined the limits of
                    communication and understanding. Beyond the horizon, there was only muteness and silence.
                    Within it, things could be made visible. But it could also be used for determining one’s own
                    location and relation to one’s surroundings, destinations, or ambitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Early navigation consisted of gestures and bodily poses relating to the horizon. “In early days,
                    [Arab navigators] used one or two fingers width, a thumb and little finger on an outstretched
                    arm, or an arrow held at arm’s length to sight the horizon at the lower end and Polaris at the
                    upper.”<a href="#footnotes"><sup>2</sup></a> The angle between the horizon and the Pole star gave
                    information about the altitude of
                    one’s position. This measurement method was known as sighting the object, shooting the object, or
                    taking a sight. In this way, one’s own location could be at least roughly determined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instruments like the astrolabe, quadrant, and sextant refined this way of gaining orientation by
                    using the horizon and the stars. One of the main obstacles with this technology was the fact
                    that the ground on which sailors stood was never stable in the first place. The stable horizon
                    mostly remained a projection, until artificial horizons were eventually invented in order to
                    create the illusion of stability.
                </p>

                        and the horizon. </figcaption>

                <p>
                    The use of the horizon to calculate position gave seafarers a sense of orientation, thus also
                    enabling colonialism and the spread of a capitalist global market, but also became an important
                    tool for the construction of the optical paradigms that came to define modernity, the most important
                    paradigm being that of so-called linear perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As early as 1028, Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham (965–1040), also known as Alhazen, wrote a book of
                    visual theory, Kitab al-Manazir. After 1200, it became available in Europe and spawned numerous
                    experiments in visual production between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, which culminated in
                    the development of linear perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Duccio’s Last Supper (1308–1311, several vanishing points are still evident. The perspectives in
                    this space do not coalesce into a horizon line, nor do they all intersect in one single vanishing
                    point.
                    But in Miracle of the Desecrated Host (Scene I (1465–69, painted by Paolo Uccello, who was one of
                    the most ardent experimenters in the development of linear perspective, the perspective is aligned
                    to culminate
                    in one single vanishing point, located on a virtual horizon defined by the eye line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Linear perspective is based on several decisive negations. First, the curvature of the earth is
                    typically disregarded. The horizon is conceived as an abstract flat line upon which the points on
                    any horizontal
                    plane converge. Additionally, as Erwin Panofsky argued, the construction of linear perspective
                    declares the view of a one-eyed and immobile spectator as a norm—and this view is itself assumed to
                    be natural,
                    scientific, and objective. Thus, linear perspective is based on an abstraction, and does not
                    correspond to any subjective perception.<a href="#footnotes"><sup>3</sup></a> Instead, it computes a
                    mathematical, flattened, infinite, continuous, and
                    homogenous space, and declares it to be reality. Linear perspective creates the illusion of a
                    quasi-natural view to the “outside,” as if the image plane was a window opening onto the “real”
                    world. This is also
                    the literal meaning of the Latin perspectiva: to see through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This space defined by linear perspective is calculable, navigable, and predictable. It allows the
                    calculation of future risk, which can be anticipated, and therefore, managed. As a consequence,
                    linear
                    perspective not only transforms space, but also introduces the notion of a linear time, which allows
                    mathematical prediction and, with it, linear progress. This is the second, temporal meaning of
                    perspective: a view onto a calculable future. As Walter Benjamin argued, time can become just as
                    homogenous and empty as space.<a href="#footnotes"><sup>4</sup></a> And for all these calculations
                    to operate, we must necessarily assume an
                    observer standing on a stable ground looking out towards a vanishing point on a flat, and actually
                    quite artificial, horizon.

                    <p>
                        But linear perspective also performs an ambivalent operation concerning the viewer. As the whole
                        paradigm converges in one of the viewer’s eyes, the viewer becomes central to the worldview
                        established
                        by it. The viewer is mirrored in the vanishing point, and thus constructed by it. The vanishing
                        point gives the observer a body and a position. But on the other hand, the spectator’s
                        importance is also
                        undermined by the assumption that vision follows scientific laws. While empowering the subject
                        by placing it at the center of vision, linear perspective also undermines the viewer’s
                        individuality by
                        subjecting it to supposedly objective laws of representation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Needless to say, this reinvention of the subject, time, and space was an additional toolkit for
                        enabling Western dominance, and the dominance of its concepts—as well as for redefining
                        standards of
                        representation, time, and space. All of these components are evident in Uccello’s six-panel
                        painting, Miracle of the Desecrated Host (1465-69. In the first panel, a woman sells a Host to a
                        Jewish merchant,
                        who in the second panel tries to “desecrate” it. For this, the Jewish merchant ends up at the
                        stakes. Along with his wife and two small children, he is tied to a pillar on which parallels
                        converge as if it
                        were a target mark. The date of these panels shortly prefigures the expulsion of Jews and
                        Muslims from Spain in 1492, also the year of Christopher Columbus’s expedition to the West
                        Indies.<a href="#footnotes"><sup>5</sup></a> In these paintings,
                        linear perspective becomes a matrix for racial and religious propaganda, and related atrocities.
                        This so-called scientific worldview helped set standards for marking people as other, thus
                        legitimizing their
                        conquest or the domination over them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, linear perspective also carries the seeds of its own downfall. Its scientific
                        allure and objectivist attitude established a universal claim for representation, a link to
                        veracity that undermined
                        particularistic worldviews, even if halfheartedly and belatedly. It thus became a hostage to the
                        truth it had so confidently proclaimed. And a deep suspicion was planted alongside its claims
                        for veracity from
                        its inception.

                <header class="downfall">The Downfall of Linear Perspective </header>
                <p>
                    But the situation now is somewhat different. We seem to be in a state of transition toward one or
                    several other visual paradigms. Linear perspective has been supplemented by other types of vision to
                    the point
                    where we may have to conclude that its status as the dominant visual paradigm is changing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This transition was already apparent in the nineteenth century in the field of painting. One work in
                    particular expresses the circumstances of this transformation: The Slave Ship (1840), by J. M. W.
                    Turner.
                    The scene in the painting represents a real incident: when the captain of a slave ship discovered
                    that his insurance only covered slaves lost at sea, and not those dying or ill on board, he ordered
                    all dying
                    and sick slaves to be thrown overboard. Turner’s painting captures the moment where the slaves are
                    beginning to go under.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this painting, the horizon line, if distinguishable at all, is tilted, curved, and troubled. The
                    observer has lost his stable position. There are no parallels that could converge at a single
                    vanishing point.
                    The sun, which is at the center of the composition, is multiplied in reflections. The observer is
                    upset, displaced, beside himself at the sight of the slaves, who are not only sinking but have also
                    had their
                    bodies reduced to fragments—their limbs devoured by sharks, mere shapes below the water surface. At
                    the sight of the effects of colonialism and slavery, linear perspective—the central viewpoint, the
                    position
                    of mastery, control, and subjecthood—is abandoned and starts tumbling and tilting, taking with it
                    the idea of space and time as systematic constructions. The idea of a calculable and predictable
                    future shows
                    a murderous side through an insurance that prevents economic loss by inspiring cold-blooded murder.
                    Space dissolves into mayhem on the unstable and treacherous surface of an unpredictable sea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turner experimented with moving perspectives early on. Legend has it that he had himself tied to the
                    mast of a ship crossing from Dover to Calais, explicitly to watch the horizon change. In 1843 or
                    1844,
                    he stuck his head out of the window of a moving train for exactly 9 minutes, the result of which was
                    a painting called Rain, Steam, and Speed—The Great Western Railway (1844). In it, linear perspective
                    dissolves into the background. There is no resolution, no vanishing point, and no clear view to any
                    past or future. Again, more interesting is the perspective of the spectator himself, who seems to be
                    dangling
                    in the air on the outer side of the rails of a railroad bridge. There is no clear ground under his
                    assumed position. He might be suspended in the mist, floating over an absent ground.
                </p>

                    In both of Turner’s paintings, the horizon is blurred, tilted, and yet not necessarily denied. The
                    paintings do not negate its existence altogether, but render it inaccessible to the viewer’s
                    perception.
                    The question of horizon starts to float, so to speak. Perspectives assume mobile points of view and
                    communication is disabled even within one common horizon. One could say that the downward motion of
                    the
                    sinking slaves affects the point of view of the painter, who tears it away from a position of
                    certitude, and subjects it to gravity and motion and the pull of a bottomless sea.

                    With the twentieth century, the further dismantling of linear perspective in a variety of areas
                    began to take hold. Cinema supplements photography with the articulation of different temporal
                    perspectives.
                    Montage becomes a perfect device for destabilizing the observer’s perspective and breaking down
                    linear time. Painting abandons representation to a large extent and demolishes linear perspective in
                    cubism,
                    collage, and different types of abstraction. Time and space are reimagined through quantum physics
                    and the theory of relativity, while perception is reorganized by warfare, advertisement, and the
                    conveyor belt.
                    With the invention of aviation, opportunities for falling, nose-diving, and crashing increase. With
                    it—and especially with the conquest of outer space—comes the development of new perspectives and
                    techniques of
                    orientation, found especially in an increasing number of aerial views of all kinds. While all these
                    developments can be described as typical characteristics of modernity, the past few years has seen
                    visual
                    culture saturated by military and entertainment images’ views from above.

                    Aircraft expand the horizon of communication and act as aerial cameras providing backgrounds for
                    aerial map views. Drones survey, track, and kill. But the entertainment industry is busy as well.
                    Especially in
                    3D cinema, the new characteristics of aerial views are fully exploited by staging vertiginous
                    flights into abysses. One could almost say that 3D and the construction of imaginary vertical worlds
                    (prefigured in
                    the logic of computer games) are essential to each other. 3D also intensifies hierarchies of
                    material required to access this new visuality. As Thomas Elsaesser has argued, a hardware
                    environment integrating
                    military, surveillance, and entertainment applications, produces new markets for hardware and
                    software.<a href="#footnotes"><sup>6</sup></a>

                    In a fascinating text, Eyal Weizman analyzes verticality in political architecture, describing the
                    spatial turn of sovereignty and surveillance in terms of a vertical 3D sovereignty.<a
                        href="#footnotes"><sup>7</sup></a> He argues that geopolitical
                    power was once distributed on a planar map-like surface on which boundaries were drawn and defended.
                    But at present, the distribution of power—he cites the Israeli occupation in Palestine as his
                    example, but
                    there could be many others—has increasingly come to occupy a vertical dimension. Vertical
                    sovereignty splits space into stacked horizontal layers, separating not only airspace from ground,
                    but also splitting
                    ground from underground, and airspace into various layers. Different strata of community are divided
                    from each other on a
                    y-axis, multiplying sites of conflict and violence. As Achille Mbembe contends,

                    But how to link this obsessive policing, division, and representation of ground to the philosophical
                    assumption that in contemporary societies there is no ground to speak of? How do these aerial
                    representations—in
                    which grounding effectively constitutes a privileged subject—link to the hypothesis that we
                    currently inhabit a condition of free fall?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The answer is simple: many of the aerial views, 3D nose-dives, Google Maps, and surveillance
                    panoramas do not actually portray a stable ground. Instead, they create a supposition that it exists
                    in the first place.
                    Retroactively, this virtual ground creates a perspective of overview and surveillance for a
                    distanced, superior spectator safely floating up in the air. Just as linear perspective established
                    an imaginary stable
                    observer and horizon, so does the perspective from above establish an imaginary floating observer
                    and an imaginary stable ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This establishes a new visual normality—a new subjectivity safely folded into surveillance
                    technology and screen-based distraction.<a href="#footnotes"><sup>9</sup></a> One might conclude
                    that this is in fact a radicalization—though not an overcoming—of
                    the paradigm of linear perspective. In it, the former distinction between object and subject is
                    exacerbated and turned into the one-way gaze of superiors onto inferiors, a looking down from high
                    to low. Additionally,
                    the displacement of perspective creates a disembodied and remote-controlled gaze, outsourced to
                    machines and other objects.<a href="#footnotes"><sup>10</sup></a> Gazes already became decisively
                    mobile and mechanized with the invention of photography,
                    but new technologies have enabled the detached observant gaze to become ever more inclusive and
                    all-knowing to the point of becoming massively intrusive—as militaristic as it is pornographic, as
                    intense as extensive,

                <p>
                    The view from above is a perfect metonymy for a more general verticalization of class relations in
                    the context of an intensified class war from above—seen through the lenses and on the screens of
                    military, entertainment,
                    and information industries.<a href="#footnotes"><sup>12</sup></a> It is a proxy perspective that
                    projects delusions of stability, safety, and extreme mastery onto a backdrop of expanded 3D
                    sovereignty. But if the new views from above recreate societies as
                    free-falling urban abysses and splintered terrains of occupation, surveilled aerially and policed
                    biopolitically, they may also—as linear perspective did—carry the seeds of their own demise within
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As linear perspective began to tumble down with the sinking bodies of slaves thrown into the ocean,
                    for many people today the simulated grounds of aerial imagery provide an illusionary tool of
                    orientation in a condition
                    in which the horizons have, in fact, been shattered. Time is out of joint and we no longer know
                    whether we are objects or subjects as we spiral down in an imperceptible free fall.<a
                        href="#footnotes"><sup>13</sup></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    But if we accept the multiplication and de-linearization of horizons and perspectives, the new tools
                    of vision may also serve to express, and even alter, the contemporary conditions of disruption and
                    disorientation.
                    Recent 3D animation technologies incorporate multiple perspectives, which are deliberately
                    manipulated to create multifocal and nonlinear imagery.<a href="#footnotes"><sup>14</sup></a>
                    Cinematic space is twisted in any way imaginable, organized around
                    heterogeneous, curved, and collaged perspectives. The tyranny of the photographic lens, cursed by
                    the promise of its indexical relation to reality, has given way to hyperreal representations—not of
                    space as it is, but
                    of space as we can make it—for better or worse. There is no need for expensive renderings; a simple
                    green screen collage yields impossible cubist perspectives and implausible concatenations of times
                    and spaces alike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, cinema has caught up with the representational freedoms of painting and structural and
                    experimental film. As it merges with graphic design practices, drawing, and collage, cinema has
                    gained independence from
                    the prescribed focal dimensions that have normalized and limited the realm of its vision. While it
                    could be argued that montage was the first step towards a liberation from cinematic linear
                    perspective—and was for this
                    reason ambivalent for most of its existence—only now can new and different sorts of spatial vision
                    be created. Similar things can be said about multiscreen projections, which create a dynamic viewing
                    space, dispersing
                    perspective and possible points of view. The viewer is no longer unified by such a gaze, but is
                    rather dissociated and overwhelmed, drafted into the production of content. None of these projection
                    spaces suppose a single
                    unified horizon. Rather, many call for a multiple spectator, who must be created and recreated by
                    ever-new articulations of the crowd.<a href="#footnotes"><sup>15</sup></a>

                <p>
                    In many of these new visualities, what seemed like a helpless tumble into an abyss actually turns
                    out to be a new representational freedom. And perhaps this helps us get over the last assumption
                    implicit in this thought
                    experiment: the idea that we need a ground in the first place. In his discussion of the vertiginous,
                    Theodor W. Adorno scoffs at philosophy’s obsession with earth and origin, with a philosophy of
                    belonging that obviously
                    comes packaged within the most violent fear of the groundless and bottomless. For him, the
                    vertiginous is not about the panicked loss of a ground imagined to be a safe haven of being:

                    in the frame-covered, never-changing realm, is true for untruth only.<a

                    A fall toward objects without reservation, embracing a world of forces and matter, which lacks any
                    original stability and sparks the sudden shock of the open: a freedom that is terrifying, utterly
                    deterritorializing,
                    and always already unknown. Falling means ruin and demise as well as love and abandon, passion and
                    surrender, decline and catastrophe. Falling is corruption as well as liberation, a condition that
                    turns people into
                    things and vice versa.<a href="#footnotes"><sup>17</sup></a> It takes place in an opening we could

                <p>
                    Finally, the perspective of free fall teaches us to consider a social and political dreamscape of
                    radicalized class war from above, one that throws jaw-dropping social inequalities into sharp focus.
                    But falling does
                    not only mean falling apart, it can also mean a new certainty falling into place. Grappling with
                    crumbling futures that propel us backwards onto an agonizing present, we may realize that the place
                    we are falling toward
                    is no longer grounded, nor is it stable. It promises no community, but a shifting formation.

                from an informal conversation with the author: “This means that stereoscopic images and the 3-D movie
                are part of the new paradigm, which is turning our information societyinto a control society and our
                visual culture into a surveillance culture. The movie industry, civil society and the military sector
                are all united in this surveillance paradigm, which, as part of a historic process, seeks to
                replace“monocular vision,” the way of seeing that has defined Western thought andaction for the last 500
                years.
                It is this means of seeing that gave rise to awide range of innovations like panel painting, colonial
                seafaring and Cartesianphilosophy, as well as the whole concept of projecting ideas, risks, chancesand
                courses of action into the future. Flight simulators and other types ofmilitary technology are part of a
                new effort to introduce 3-D as the standardmeans of perception—but the development goes even further
                to include surveillance. This encompasses an entire catalog of movements and behaviors,all of which are
                intrinsically connected to the monitoring, steering andobservation of ongoing processes, and which
                delegate or outsource what was oncereferred to as introspection, self-awareness and personal
                responsibility.”Thomas Elsaesser, “TheDimension of Depth and Objects Rushing Towards Us. Or: The Tail

                11. In fact, the perspective of the floating camera belongs to a dead man. Most recently, a
                dehumanization (or posthumanization) of the gaze is perhaps nowhere as literally allegorized as in the
                film
                Enter the Void (Gaspar Noé,2010), where, for most of the film, a disembodied point of view endlessly
                drifts over Tokyo. This gaze penetrates any space, moving without constraint and with unrestricted
                mobility, looking for a body in which to biologically reproduce itself and reincarnate. The point of
                view in Enter the Void is reminiscent of the gaze of a drone. But instead of bringing death, it is
                looking to recreate its own life. To this end, the protagonist basically wants to hijack a fetus. But
                the film is also very picky about this procedure: mixed race fetuses get aborted in favor of white
                ones.There are more issues that link the movie to reactionary breeding ideologies. Floating and
                biopolitical policing are mixed into acomputer-animated obsession with superior bodies, remote control,
                and digital aerial vision. The floating gaze of the dead man thus literally echoes Achille Mbembe’s
                powerful description of necropower: necropower regulates life through the perspective of death.
                Could these tropes allegorized in a single (and frankly, god-awful)movie be expanded into a more general
                analysis of disembodied hovering point of views? Do the aerial views, drone perspectives,
                and 3D dives into abysses stand in for the gazes of “dead white males,” a worldview which lost its
                vitality, yet persists as an undead but powerful tool to police the world and control its own
                reproduction?
